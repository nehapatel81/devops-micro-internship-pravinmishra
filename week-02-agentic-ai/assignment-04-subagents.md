# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

The cost optimizer uses Haiku because it is faster and more cost-effective for simple analysis tasks. It provides sufficient performance for cost calculations without the higher cost of using Sonnet.

---

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?

The security auditor does not have the Write tool because its role is to review, analyze, and report security issues, not modify files. This helps prevent accidental or unauthorized changes and follows the principle of least privilege.

---

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

The tf-writer uses inherit so it automatically uses the model configured by the parent or main process. This makes the configuration more flexible, avoids hardcoding a specific model, and allows the script to adapt if the default model changes.

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — The delegation message showing Claude launched the security-auditor

#### Screenshot 5 — Security audit report output

# Task 4 — Run the Cost Optimizer

## Goal

Trigger the cost optimizer agent and review the generated cost optimization report.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — The full cost optimization report
